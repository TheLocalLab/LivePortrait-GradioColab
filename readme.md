### For those who prefer visual guidance, I've created a comprehensive step-by-step video tutorial demonstrating the installation process for Live Portrait on Windows devices. This guide will walk you through setting up and running the application locally.

While the tutorial focuses on Windows, the process should be similar for Linux and macOS users. However, please note that I haven't personally tested the installation on these platforms.

If you encounter any issues or have questions specific to non-Windows operating systems, feel free to open an issue, and I'll do my best to assist you.
